Hi,

I'm Marija, a software engineer based in London, UK.

I'm currently working in Ruby, but I don't like to be label as only Ruby engineer.
I'm always open to new languages and technologies, as long it is fun and exciting :)

My life path of becoming a developer goes like this:
after I've finished my master studies in Information and Communication Technology in Zagreb, Croatia, I started working in a small software company as an intern.
Not long after, I moved to London and since then I'm mastering my skills.
At the moment, I' working in [Dressipi](https://dressipi.com/), a fashion prediction platform as a backend engineer.
For more details, you can always visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marija-mandic/) account.

Enjoy my blog!
